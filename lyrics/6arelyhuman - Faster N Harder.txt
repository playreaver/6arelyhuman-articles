[00:00] (asteria)
[00:02] (6a-6a-6arelyhuman)

[00:05] So I party like a rock star, look like a porn star
[00:09] Every day I go hard, riding in my sports car
[00:13] Pull off in that V8, songs on replay
[00:17] Spinnin' like a DJ, make it look easy

[00:21] 'Cause I go faster and harder, faster and harder
[00:26] I go faster and harder, bitch, I feel like a monster
[00:31] I go faster and harder, f-f-f-f-faster and harder
[00:36] I-I-I go faster and harder, I-I-I-I-I feel like a monster

[00:41] We turn it up, we don't give a fuck
[00:44] And we live it up, you can't get with us
[00:47] I just need a buzz, let me roll it up
[00:50] In the Bentley truck with a 2-liter
[00:53] I look like I'm JWOWW
[00:55] Dance, dance, dance like I'm Deena
[00:58] 'Cause I'm feeling so scene
[01:00] And you're just giving John Cena
[01:03] 'Cause no one can see ya when their eyes are on me
[01:06] Yeah, I'm your strange addiction, just like TLC
[01:09] You can't come into my crib, this ain't MTV
[01:12] I feel like SUICIDAL-IDOL, too much ecstasy

[01:16] P-p-p-p-party like a rock star, look like a porn star
[01:20] Every day I go hard, riding in my sports car
[01:24] Pull off in that V8, songs on replay
[01:28] Spinnin' like a DJ, make it look easy

[01:32] 'Cause I go faster and harder, faster and harder
[01:37] I go faster and harder, bitch, I feel like a monster
[01:42] I go faster and harder, f-f-f-f-faster and harder
[01:47] I-I-I go faster and harder, I-I-I-I-I feel like a monster

[01:53] (Faster and harder, faster and harder)
[01:56] (I go faster and harder, bitch, I feel like a monster)
[01:59] (I go faster, faster and harder)
[02:02] (I-I-I go faster and harder, I-I-I-I-I feel like a monster)
